"""
End-to-end test for heartbeat retry behavior.

Uses a real HTTP server (no mocks) to verify that:
1. The monitor thread doesn't block when trigger returns 502
2. finish() completes promptly even when the trigger endpoint is down
3. The heartbeat uses max_retries=0 and short timeout (fire-and-forget)

This test would have caught the production incident where 502s on the
trigger endpoint caused _worker_monitor to block for 7-135 seconds per
cycle (4 retries × 32s timeout), making finish() hang.
